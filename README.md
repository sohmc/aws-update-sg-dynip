# Update your AWS Security Group with your Dynamic IP address

This script is a sister to [CloudFlare DDNS Updater](../../../cloudflare-ddns-py) but can be run independently.

The goal for this script is to update an AWS Security Group with your dynamically-assigned IP address.  Typical use case is that you have an IP address at home that is assigned by your ISP and is not assigned to you.  You use this IP address to secure your AWS Virtual Private Cloud by only allowing traffic from this IP address.

Directions on how to set this up is in the [Wiki](../../wiki).
